Introducing Color Profiles.  Previously, the Tour mode applied random colors.
Random colors [were ugly](img/ugly_random_colors.png)!  Now only colors from
your enabled sequences are randomly applied, with the results below.  Note that
this only affects Tour and Interactive modes.  Coloring mode still uses the
originl color chooser.

<hr>
This was done in "Coloring" mode, where the user sets each individual color
before clicking on map countries to apply the color.
